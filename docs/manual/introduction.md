# Introduction
Welcome! Opsloom is a blueprint project to build enterprise-ready custom AI applications. Opsloom supports a variety of AI models and techniques to help you build assistants that can understand and generate human language. These assistants can be used to automate tasks, provide information, or interact with users. You can build your own custom assistants or use the pre-built ones provided by Opsloom.

Opsloom supports various techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to provide assistants with external knowledge bases, text-to-SQL to enable users to query data interactively, agentic frameworks to interact with large language models (LLMs) and accomplish complex workflows, and more.

Opsloom provides the framework and constructs so that you can expand and customize the assistants to meet your specific enterprise needs. You can also embed the chatbot experiences into existing applications and ecosystems, enabling smooth integration with enterprise workflows.

Enjoy building your custom AI applications with Opsloom!
